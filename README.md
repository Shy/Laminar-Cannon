**About the Nukit Laminar Cannon**
---
The Laminar Cannon is an experimental device for directing a cohesive stream of highly filtered air at an individual in motion.

![Nukit Open Air Purifier v1.0](https://github.com/opennukit/Nukit-Open-Air-Purifier/blob/main/Nukit-Open-Air-Purifier-3-v1.0.jpg?raw=true)

There have been ongoing efforts to build laminar flow air filters in an attempt to create a pocket of clean air around an individual. Dilution is an accepted method of reducing the pathogen load in a given space, and this can, with some difficulty, be done somewhat locally. “Somewhat” because air is a fluid and wants to mix, so this is an extremely challenging task to accomplish, and the reduction is usually modest at best.

There has been some success in creating a zone of cleaner air, only to find another problem- if the target of that cohesive air stream moves even slightly off-axis, they are no longer breathing filtered air.

What the Laminar Cannon attempts to do is solve a hardware problem with software, using modern, low-cost face-tracking hardware to ensure that the cohesive air stream is always directed at the target individual. 

While this proof of concept uses a small, low-cost, consumer face tracking device and DIY tripod-mounted laminar air purifier designed by Nukit, the output of far more powerful and silent filtration units could be directed through large bore flexible conduits to standard computer-controlled gimbals of the type already used for remote cameras. Multiple units could be mounted on lighting scaffolding and triangulated on high-profile performers to prevent missed performances (with hopefully appropriate mitigations for the audience as well).

The concept extends to 222nm Far-UVC. Depth cameras and off-the-shelf software running on low-cost hardware could easily set up multiple tracking "spotlights" to follow a performer's position on stage and adjust their power output in response to distance, ensuring the performer stays within safe TLV- allowing full protection in venues too large to completely saturate with Far-UVC.

**Further development of this concept will focus on three key tasks:**
---
* Using computational fluid dynamic software to create more efficient laminar nozzle genometries.
* Vetting face-tracking software packages to ensure optimal performance for this specific task.
* Examining the viability of semi-localized Far-UVC as a mitigation method if multiple emitters are triangulated on a subject, either on its own or augmenting ambient Far-UVC covering a larger area and low power.

**FAQ**
---
**Will you be offering a complete, detailed build manual?**

The STL files and BOM are sufficient for a reasonably handy person to construct one for experimentation and iteration. Given their effectiveness has not been quantified, making them too accessible is not really a feature in this case.


**Does this replace a well-fitted respirator?**

No. Almost nothing does. This device may- with some iteration, offer some level of protection in parts of the world where local regimes are passing draconian laws that prevent masking.


**Where can I buy this? Will you sell it?**

As an industrial process, thin laser-cut material is ideal when you need to make 5-500 of something (at which point you look at sheet metal or injection molded plastic). Hand-operated power tools are well suited to making one or two boxes like this but the time and labor required are substantial. Custom speaker enclosure builders can give you a quote for comparison as the specifications are very similar. Since most locations will require four or more air purifiers for full coverage, laser cutting is a very cost-effective option. The cost drops substantially as quantities go up, so group buys are an excellent idea.

**Will you make a version with...**

Hang on for a few weeks; we'll have an easy-to-use web app that will let you specify what sort of layout you want and then generate the files for you.

**I have ME/CFS, POTS, Long-COVID. Will I be able to do this?**

We think so, or let us know and we'll make changes so you can. Clear a work area that you can utilize for as long as you need- even days are fine. They key is you only need to glue one panel at a time- gluing all at once is for the impatient and offers little benefit. Spread your glue, place your piece firmly in the slots, wipe up excess with a damp sponge, close your glue, and return the next day, or even the next week- whenever you have the spoons for another piece. The entire assembly process can be broken into 5-minute segments.

**Who made this?**

“Skunk Works” in this context refers to special concept builds intended for limited deployment. These are used to gauge consumer acceptance, practicality, and technical feasibility of novel mitigation measures. The knowledge gained in that process may result in production units or simply additional data points to shape future product development.
